This is a Welcome To program with a working board and cards feature.

To start off, this is written in Java using [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)

Using the board png, the face card file, and the number card file, you will have to insert the file paths into the code.

The png path will go on line 57, the number card file path on line 58, and face card path on 59. You will need to replace the back slashes in the path with forward slashes when pasted into the code.

The actual code works by right clicking on houses and point bubbles to interact with them and left clicking, dragging and releasing to create a line for fences. 

The card flipping feature is used by clicking the "New Round" button at the top. To reset everything including the stuff on the board, click the "Shuffle and Reset Board" button.
